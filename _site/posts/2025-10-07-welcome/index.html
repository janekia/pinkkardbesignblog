        <p>Hey there 👋🏽 — I’m <strong>Janekia</strong>, the heart and hands behind <strong>Pinkkard Design</strong>.</p>
<p>Welcome to my little corner of the web where creativity meets purpose. Here, you’ll find a mix of web design insights, behind-the-scenes looks at my projects, branding tips for small businesses, and personal growth reflections from my journey as a designer and entrepreneur.</p>
<p>I believe great design isn’t just about how something looks — it’s about how it <em>feels</em> and how it <em>works</em> for real people. My goal is to share what I’ve learned (and what I’m still learning!) in a way that helps others bring their ideas to life, build confidence in their craft, and maybe even get inspired to start their own creative projects.</p>
<p>✨ Expect posts about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building and customizing websites with modern tools</li>
<li>Branding and visual identity tips for small business owners</li>
<li>Design process walk-throughs and case studies</li>
<li>Creative motivation, balance, and lessons learned along the way</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for stopping by — grab a cup of coffee, explore, and let’s grow together 🌿</p>
<p>— <strong>Janekia @ Pinkkard Design</strong></p>
